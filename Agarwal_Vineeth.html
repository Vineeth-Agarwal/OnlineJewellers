					<h3 > <br>My Roots and me until today.</h3>
					<p class="text">I was born in Hyderabad, India to a Marwari Family and hence our roots are connected to Rajasthan. 	I obtained my bachelors
					degree in Computer Science <br> from JNTU Hyderabad in 2014. I worked with a start up and also with TCS for over 3 years altogether 
					   after undergraduation. </p>

					<h3> Reason why I am here today.</h3>
					<p class="text">My zeal to learn and grow in the field of computer science have made me get off from the saturated routine 
					work and pursue my masters. <br> I would like to complete my Masters with distinction and land up in a better position in 
					the field of technology. </p>

					<h3> 
					What I like and what am I upto.
					</h3>
					<p class="text"> Having worked for an analytics start up company, I would more likely be interested to start one on my 
					own in near future. <br> The programming languages I like the most are perl,cobol,java. I am very much fond of learning
					 the concept  <br> behind dynamic websites 
					 like Cricbuzz	and the web apps like microsoft outlook. Apart from technology, <br>I am fond of teaching, 
					playing chess & cricket, and watching cricket.</p>
